rick-roll-bpf
-------------

Intercepts the "openat" system call for "*.mp3" files and changes
the "pathname[]" argument to "/tmp/rick-roll.mp3" using "fentry"
hooks with an eBPF program.

TL;DR: Do you want to see someone get RickRoll'D every time they play
       an MP3 file on their machine? If the answer is yes - you are at
       the right place (probably).

HOW-TO
  - Build and generate the binary ("rick-roll"):

    $ make [V=(0|1) [BUILD_SHARED=(true|false)
      [OBJ_DIR=<path> [BIN_DIR=<path>]]]]

   +--------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | Argument     | Description                                     |
   +--------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | V            | Output verbosity (0: disabled, 1: enabled);     |
   |              | disabled by default.                            |
   +--------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | BUILD_SHARED | Compile the binary with shared ("true") or      |
   |              | static ("false") `libbpf` library; set to       |
   |              | "true" by default.                              |
   +--------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | OBJ_DIR      | Place intermediate objects at the given "path"; |
   |              | default path is "./obj".                        |
   +--------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | BIN_DIR      | Install the built binary at the given "path";   |
   |              | default path is "./bin".                        |
   +--------------+-------------------------------------------------+

  - Change the watch extension from ".mp3", or the "pathname[]"
    argument to something else:

    Replace the following "#define" directives in the source:
      * #define WATCH_EXT ".ext"
      * #define REPL_PATH "/path/to/file"

    Make sure that there is a file at "REPL_PATH".


NOTES
  - Please _don't_ run this in production environments.

  - Works on "linux-5.8.0-25-generic" (x86_64).

  - The "libbpf" directory is a submodule of this repository.
    Running "git-clone" with "--recurse-submodules" will get
    that as well.

WHY
  - I wanted to have some fun and learn a little bit about eBPF.
